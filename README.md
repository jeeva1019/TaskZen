# TaskZen

TaskZen is a simple and interactive to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, complete, delete, and filter tasks while storing them in local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks individually.
- **Filter Tasks**: Supports filtering tasks based on their status (All, Active, Completed).
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout (Bootstrap 5 used for additional styling).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and task management logic.
